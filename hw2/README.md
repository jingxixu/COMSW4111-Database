## Usage 
I finished **all** homework specifications and all screenshots demonstrating the functionalities can be found under `/screenshots`. The changes I made to the tables in `lahman2017raw` are in `changes.sql`.

To run the code:
1. `cd` into the `/code` folder and run `python SimpleFlask.py`
2. After the flask backend has started, either run `python unit_test.py` with any tests in that file or start Postman and request a particular URL
