    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submission:\n",
    "    - The exam is due on 16-Dec-2018 at 11:59PM. __You may not use grace days.__\n",
    "    - Submission:\n",
    "        - Submission format is a zip file of this Jupyter Notebook with your solutions entered into the code cells or Markdown cells for each question. If you embed images or diagrams, you need to include in the zip file. \n",
    "        - You submit your zip file containing the notebook with answers on CourseWorks under \"Final Examination\" assignment.\n",
    "        - No other formats are allowed.\n",
    "        - If the notebook format is incorrect or the notebook is corrupted, the grade is 0.\n",
    "        - Submissions after the due date and time are not allowed. Submissions not received on time receive a grade of 0.\n",

    "            - Your code and SQL MUST use userid ```dbuser``` and password ```dbuser``` for connecting to the database.\n",
    "            - You must install and use [%SQL Magic for iPtython](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql) for executing any SQL statements in the notebook.\n",

    "    - Questions requiring SQL have empty code cells where you enter your statements. Some also contain sample answers to help you determine if your answer is correct. You must show the execution of your SQL in your submission. You may use LIMIT 10 to reduce the size of results.\n",
    "    - Creating test data is part of designing and implementing database solutions. You may need to create test data and add to the database for some questions. All new tables and data go into the schema you create that is your UNI.\n",

    "    - The bonus question is worth 1 point.\n",
    "    - I do not want to hear any complaining about how the questions in section 3 are much more than 2x as hard as the questions in section 4. If I hear that complaining, I will make the questions in section 4 harder."

    "HW5 focuses on determining the number of games a team will win as a function of performance summary information, e.g. on-base percentage, earned run average. We can use SQL JOINs, aggregation and functions to compute the corresponding metrics for individual players. Producing a winning team boils down to finding a set of players whose combined individual performance produces winning metrics for the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is a little more complicated, however. There are constraints:\n",
    "1. Acquiring the best performers may be prohibitively expensive.\n",
    "2. A team needs players in various positions or roles, e.g. catchers, pitchers, short stops, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to making progress relative to the constraints is to compute a player's performance per dollar of salary. This problem is a very simple first step focusing on [catchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher).\n",
    "\n",
    "We first have to determine which players have played as catchers. We can determine this by the _POS_ column of the _Fielding_ table. The position code for a catcher is \"C.\" The column _InnOuts_ defines for how many \"outs\" a player played a position in a year. Since there are 27 outs per side per games, _sum(InnOuts)/27_ approximates the number of games a player played catcher. To identity catchers,\n",
    "- We only consider _Fielding_ entries for 1950 or later.\n",
    "- We only consider a player a potential catcher if the player's career _sum(InnOuts)/27_ is greater than or equal to 162.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on offensive matrics, specifically on-base percentage. Computing offensive price effectiveness requires information from three tables:\n",
    "- Batting:\n",
    "    - total_hits is sum(h) for the player's entire career.\n",
    "    - total_abs is sum(ab) for the player's entire career.\n",
    "    - batting_average is total_hits/total_abs\n",
    "- Fielding:\n",
    "    - total_outs is the career sum(InnOuts) for a player when catching, e.g. _Fielding.pos='C'.\n",
    "    - total\\_gs is the sum of gs (games started) as a catcher.\n",
    "    - games is the sum of g.\n",
    "    - total_outs is the sum of InnOuts\n",
    "    - computed_games is sum(InnOuts)/27\n",
    "- Salary:\n",
    "    - salary_seasons is the number of seasons for which we have salary information. __We only consider players in the answer for whom we have at least 3 seasons of salary information.__\n",
    "    - avg_salary is the average of the salary per year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We derive an offensive performance/salary dollar as $ba\\_dollar$ = $batting\\_average/avg\\_salary*10000$. We multiple to 10,000 to have larger numbers for comparison. Using the rules above, write a single SQL query that produces the information in the table below. Your initial results should be ordered by batting_average descending.

    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- When discussing Moneyball, we discussed figuring out wins as a function to team metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A team is a combination of players, and their performance determines the team's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A player's performance data is spread over several tables:\n",
    "    - Salary\n",
    "    - Batting\n",
    "    - Fielding\n",
    "    - Pitching\n",
    "    - Appearances\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- We will produce a table that summarizes player's performance metrics. We will look at the following columns:\n",
    "    - Batting: G, AB, R, H, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, BB, HBP\n",
    "    - Pitching: G, W, L, IPOuts, H, ER\n",
    "    - Fielding: G, PO, PA, PE, IFO, IFA, IFE, OFO, OFA, OFE, CO, CA, CE\n",
    "        - There are three groups of positions: outfield (OF), infield (IF), pitcher (P), catcher (C)\n",
    "            - xO means InnOuts when playing in one of the groups.\n",
    "            - xA means A for the position.\n",
    "            - xE means E for the position.\n",
    "        - Values should be NULL if the player did not play at the position.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Simplifications:\n",
    "    - We will ignore Salary and Appearances.\n",
    "    - We will also ignore seasons prior to 2010.\n",
    "    - Do not include batting information for a season with less than 100 at bats. Do not including batting information for a batter with less than 500 career at bats.\n",
    "    - Do not include pitching information for a season with less than 50 IPOuts. Ignore pitching information for players with less than 150 career IPOuts.\n",
    "    - Do not include fielding information for a player at a position if the player played less than 50 InnOuts at the position in a season. Also, ignore if the career total is less than 150 for the position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Produce the summary table. \n",
    "    - This should be a copy table.\n",
    "    - You may create intermediate copy tables.\n",
    "    - You can create your tables using the ```create table xxx as select ... from yyy```\n",
    "    - Show all of you create table statements.\n",
